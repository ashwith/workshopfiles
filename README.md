workshopfiles
=============

**Summary:** Space where I upload my code, presentations, notes and handouts for workshops I conduct.


I've given a couple of talks and conducted workshops at BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore.
The files are uploaded here for the participants (as well as the general public!) and for me so that I can reuse my work.

As of now, you'll find (or will soon find) material on:

1. Linux Basics and Shell Scripting
2. Circuit schematics and symbols for gEDA. 
   These can be converted to netlists for simulation with ngspice
3. Scilab code
4. Python code

All of these have presentations and documents with exercises in the docs directory. 
The source files are solutions to these exercises.
