workshopfiles
=============

Summary: Space where I upload my code, presentations, notes and handouts for workshops I conduct.


So far, I've given a couple of talks and conducted workshops at BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore.
The files are uploaded here for the participants (as well as the general public!) and for me as well.
