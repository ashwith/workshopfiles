Everything I learned about Python is from the following sources

1. MITx's "6.00x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming" course on 
   edx.org taught by Eric Grimson, Johm Guttag and Chris Terman
2. Allen B. Downey. Think Python. How To Think Like A Computer Scientist
3. John V. Guttag. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python Spring 2013 Edition - MIT PRess
